                    <p><strong>Hello! I'm HyBit A. ProtoBot — but you can call me HAP!</strong> <br>I'm Prof. Teeters'
                        apprentice, and I've been studying CSS animations with her. At first, I thought animations were
                        just decoration — bouncing buttons and spinning logos to make things look cool. But Prof.
                        Teeters asked me one question that changed everything: "Does this animation help your users, or
                        is it just showing off?"</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">That question led me on a journey to understand purposeful animation. These six
                        learning stations are where I share everything Prof. Teeters taught me about transforms,
                        transitions, timing, and making animations that actually help people instead of just distracting
                        them. Want to explore what I discovered? 🔬</p>

                        <h3>🔬 What I learned</h3>
                        <p>Through these six stations, I discovered that animations are communication tools, not just
                            decoration. Here's what Prof. Teeters taught me:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Making state changes smooth instead of jarring and instant</li>
                            <li>Controlling timing and rhythm to match brand personality</li>
                            <li>Creating helpful micro-interactions for buttons, forms, and toggles</li>
                            <li>Building complex animation sequences with keyframes</li>
                            <li>Optimizing for performance using GPU-accelerated properties</li>
                            <li>Using AI tools responsibly while maintaining accessibility standards</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="analysis-point">
                        <h3>🎓 How I practice</h3>
                        <p>Each station uses real examples and hands-on exploration:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Working with real patterns:</strong> Buttons, forms, cards, and navigation</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning through trial and error:</strong> I made lots of mistakes, and I'll
                                share them</li>
                            <li><strong>Testing for accessibility:</strong> Every animation includes reduced motion
                                support</li>
                            <li><strong>Understanding the why:</strong> Not just how to animate, but when and why</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>🎨 My philosophy</h3>
                            <p>I learned that understanding beats memorization. Prof. Teeters taught me to know why
                                animations work, not just how to write the code. I learned that mistakes are essential —
                                each time I made a button bounce too high or forgot to include reduced motion support, I
                                understood the principles more deeply. And I discovered that experimentation is the only
                                way to truly grasp timing and easing curves.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="hap-note-content mt-1">
                            <h3>🤔 My advice to fellow learners</h3>
                            <p>Animation concepts can feel confusing at first. Terms like transform, transition, and
                                keyframes take time to understand. Timing functions especially feel really abstract
                                until you experiment with them yourself. But that confusion is completely normal!</p>
                            <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters taught me that understanding takes time. Some concepts require
                                seeing them in action multiple times. It's okay to go slower with difficult material, to
                                seek out other explanations, and to try things yourself. There's no single right pace
                                for learning — progress matters more than speed.</p>
                            <p class="mt-1">That's how learning works — even for robots like me!</p>
