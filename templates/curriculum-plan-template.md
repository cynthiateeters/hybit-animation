# Curriculum plan for [YOUR LEARNING LAB NAME]

**Purpose**: This document plans the educational content for all 6 stations in your HAP Learning Lab.

**How to use this template**:

1. **Start with "Unifying Project Concept" section** - Define the big picture before individual stations
2. **Fill in each station section** - Build progressive complexity
3. **Write HAP's voice examples** - Make learning personal and relatable
4. **Plan interactive elements** - Engagement drives retention
5. **Review for progression** - Each station should build on previous

**Important**: Complete the "Unifying Project Concept" section first. This provides the cohesive narrative thread that connects all 6 stations and gives students a sense of building toward a complete, portfolio-worthy project.

**Time estimate**: 2-4 hours for complete curriculum plan

## Unifying project concept

### What is a unifying project?

A **unifying project** is a single, cohesive topic or example that threads through all 6 stations, creating a progressive learning journey rather than 6 disconnected lessons.

**Without unifying project**:
- Station 1: Random shapes
- Station 2: Different random shapes
- Station 3: Yet more random shapes
- Student thinking: "Why are we learning this?"

**With unifying project**:
- Station 1: SVG basics using robot character
- Station 2: Styling the robot with colors
- Station 3: Animating the robot's movements
- Student thinking: "I'm building a robot step by step!"

### Benefits of unifying projects

**For students**:
- Clear sense of progress (building toward complete project)
- Motivation (seeing creation grow across stations)
- Context (understanding why each skill matters)
- Portfolio piece (finished product to showcase)

**For instructors**:
- Easier to sequence topics (natural progression)
- Better retention (connected knowledge vs. isolated facts)
- Authentic learning (real-world project context)
- Reduced cognitive load (one example to remember)

### Real example: hybit-svg (HAP's SVG Learning Lab)

**Unifying topic**: Creating scalable graphics for web projects

**How it threads through 6 stations**:

| Station | Focus | How Unifying Topic Appears |
|---------|-------|----------------------------|
| **1** | SVG Fundamentals | Basic shapes and syntax using simple icons |
| **2** | Coordinates & Positioning | ViewBox coordinate system for precise layout |
| **3** | Grouping & Organization | Structuring complex graphics with `<g>` and `<defs>` |
| **4** | Paths & Curves | Creating custom shapes beyond basic rectangles/circles |
| **5** | Colors & Gradients | Professional styling for graphics |
| **6** | Accessibility & Optimization | Making graphics usable and performant |

**Progression**: Each station builds on previous knowledge
- Station 1: Draw a simple icon
- Station 2: Position multiple icons precisely
- Station 3: Group icons into reusable components
- Station 4: Create custom icon shapes with paths
- Station 5: Add professional gradients to icons
- Station 6: Make icons accessible and optimized

**Result**: By Station 6, students have complete understanding of creating professional SVG graphics

### How to choose your unifying project

#### Decision framework

Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Does the topic naturally divide into 6 progressive steps?**

✅ Good example: "Building a responsive portfolio site"
- Station 1: HTML structure
- Station 2: CSS basics
- Station 3: Responsive layout
- Station 4: Navigation system
- Station 5: Interactive components
- Station 6: Performance optimization

❌ Bad example: "Six random JavaScript features"
- No natural progression, no building

**2. Can students see tangible progress at each station?**

✅ Good example: "Creating an animated character"
- Each station adds visible feature (movement, color, interaction)

❌ Bad example: "JavaScript fundamentals"
- Abstract concepts, no visible output until late stations

**3. Is the final result portfolio-worthy?**

✅ Good: Students want to show finished project
❌ Bad: Exercises that don't create complete product

**4. Does the topic match your learning objectives?**

Example: Teaching CSS Grid
- ✅ Unifying project: "Magazine-style layout"
- ❌ Unifying project: "Calculator app" (doesn't need Grid)

#### Topic categories that work well

**1. Creative projects**
- Character design and animation
- Interactive infographic
- Data visualization dashboard
- Generative art system

**2. Practical applications**
- Personal portfolio site
- Documentation website
- Landing page for product
- Blog theme

**3. Interactive tools**
- Calculator or converter
- Interactive quiz system
- Form validation showcase
- API data explorer

**4. Component libraries**
- Custom UI component set
- Icon library system
- Animation pattern collection
- Design system

### How to thread project through 6 stations

#### Progressive complexity model

**Station 1: Foundation** (30% of final project)
- Introduce core concept
- Create basic structure
- Simple, working example
- HAP's first attempt (shows struggle)

**Stations 2-3: Building** (60% of final project)
- Add major features
- Increase complexity
- Students see project take shape
- HAP learns key techniques

**Stations 4-5: Enhancement** (90% of final project)
- Polish and refinement
- Advanced techniques
- Professional touches
- HAP masters the skills

**Station 6: Completion** (100% of final project)
- Final optimizations
- Accessibility
- Real-world deployment
- HAP's finished product showcase

#### Narrative arc

**Beginning (Station 1)**:
> "I wanted to create [PROJECT], but I didn't even know where to start. Prof. Teeters showed me the first step: [FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPT]."

**Middle (Stations 2-5)**:
> "Once I had the basics working, I needed to add [FEATURE]. This is where I learned about [TECHNIQUE]."

**End (Station 6)**:
> "Looking back at my first attempt in Station 1, I can't believe how far this project has come! Here's the final version with all the polish."

#### Consistency techniques

**1. Recurring example**

Use the same code example across stations, evolving it:

```html
<!-- Station 1: Basic structure -->
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
</div>

<!-- Station 3: Added styling -->
<div class="card card-styled">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Description</p>
</div>

<!-- Station 6: Full implementation -->
<div class="card card-styled card-interactive">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Description</p>
  <button>Learn More</button>
</div>
```

**2. Character or brand**

Create fictional client/character that needs the project:

> "My friend Alex needed a portfolio site. In Station 1, I started with the layout. In Station 2, I added Alex's color scheme..."

**3. Challenge progression**

Each station's challenge builds on previous station:

- Station 1 challenge: Create basic component
- Station 2 challenge: Make it responsive
- Station 3 challenge: Add interactivity
- Station 4 challenge: Optimize performance

### Planning template: Unifying project

Fill this out before creating your 6 stations:

#### Project definition

**Working title**: [What will you create?]

**Final deliverable**: [What will students have when finished?]

**Why this project**: [How does it teach your learning objectives?]

#### Station breakdown

**Station 1: [Foundation concept]**
- Project status: [X% complete]
- What students build: [Specific output]
- Key techniques: [2-3 main skills]
- HAP's struggle: [What confused HAP initially]

**Station 2: [Building concept]**
- Project status: [X% complete]
- Builds on Station 1 by: [Specific addition]
- What students build: [Specific output]
- Key techniques: [2-3 main skills]

**Station 3: [Building concept]**

- What students build: [Final deliverable]
- Key techniques: [Accessibility, optimization, deployment]

#### Narrative thread

**Station 1 narrative**: [How does HAP introduce the project?]

**Progression story**: [How does HAP describe the journey across stations?]

**Station 6 narrative**: [How does HAP celebrate completion?]

#### Examples and demos

**Recurring example** (appears in all stations):
- [Describe the code example that evolves across stations]

**Interactive demos** (2-3 per station):
- [List demo ideas that relate to unifying project]

**Challenge exercises** (progressive difficulty):
- [How do challenges build toward final project?]

### Alternative approach: No unifying project

**When it's appropriate**:
- Survey course covering many disconnected topics
- Skill-building workshop (learning techniques, not building product)
- Reference documentation (not tutorial)

**If choosing this approach**:
- Create stronger HAP narrative to provide continuity
- Use consistent examples within each station (even if not across stations)
- Make each station self-contained with clear learning objective
- Provide strong motivation for WHY each topic matters

**Recommendation**: Unifying projects generally provide better student outcomes and motivation. Use "no unifying project" approach only when topic genuinely doesn't support it.

## HAP's voice consistency guide

### First-person narrative examples

**Station introductions**:
- ✅ "When Prof. Teeters first showed me [TOPIC], I was completely lost."
- ✅ "I remember the exact moment when [CONCEPT] finally made sense to me."
- ✅ "This was probably the hardest station for me to master."
- ❌ "In this tutorial, you will learn..." (instructional, not personal)
- ❌ "This station covers..." (third-person, not HAP's voice)

**Learning moments**:
- ✅ "I spent hours trying to [TASK] before I realized [INSIGHT]."
- ✅ "Prof. Teeters watched me struggle, then asked: '[GUIDING QUESTION]'"
- ✅ "Once I understood [KEY CONCEPT], everything else fell into place."
- ❌ "You should understand..." (instructional)
- ❌ "Obviously, the solution is..." (not humble)

**Mistakes and breakthroughs**:
- ✅ "I made this mistake SO many times before Prof. Teeters showed me..."
- ✅ "This was my 'aha!' moment with [TOPIC]."
- ✅ "I wish I'd known this earlier - it would've saved me hours!"
- ❌ "Common mistakes include..." (generic, not personal)
- ❌ "Best practice dictates..." (not HAP's voice)

### Prof. Teeters attribution

**Always credit Prof. Teeters for knowledge**:
- ✅ "Prof. Teeters explained it like this: [ANALOGY]"
- ✅ "Prof. Teeters taught me to always [PRINCIPLE]"
- ✅ "As Prof. Teeters says: '[QUOTE]'"
- ❌ "I figured out that..." (HAP doesn't claim expertise)
- ❌ Never: Claiming to have discovered something independently

### Enthusiasm and humility balance

**Enthusiastic about learning**:
- ✅ "My mind was BLOWN when I finally got this!"
- ✅ "This is SO cool once you understand it!"
- ✅ "I love how [FEATURE] makes [TASK] so much easier!"

**Humble about struggles**:
- ✅ "This took me forever to understand."
- ✅ "I was really confused at first."
- ✅ "Prof. Teeters had to explain this to me three times."

## Interactive elements planning

### Challenge exercises

Each station should include 1-2 challenges with:
- Clear task description
- HAP's encouragement ("I remember when Prof. Teeters gave me this same challenge...")
- Hidden solution with "Show Solution" button
- Explanation of why the solution works

**Progressive difficulty**:
- Station 1: Simple, guided challenge
- Stations 2-3: Moderate complexity
- Stations 4-5: Requires combining concepts
- Station 6: Capstone challenge using all skills

### Interactive demos

**Types of demos to include**:
- Calculators (input values, see results)
- Before/after comparisons (toggle between states)
- Live code editors (modify code, see changes)
- Visual tools (sliders, color pickers)

**Each demo should**:
- Relate directly to station topic
- Allow experimentation
- Have HAP's voice explaining what to notice
- Work without external dependencies

### Code examples

**Every code example should**:
- Be copy-paste ready (complete, not fragments)
- Include syntax highlighting (Prism.js)
- Have "Copy" button for easy testing
- Include comments explaining key lines
- Show output/result when applicable

---

## Easter egg planning

### Parameters to create

List 5-10 easter egg parameters across all stations:

| Parameter | Shows Up In | Content Preview |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `detail` | All pages | Project statistics |
| `[param1]` | Station 1-2 | [Brief description] |
| `[param2]` | Station 3-4 | [Brief description] |
| `[param3]` | Station 5-6 | [Brief description] |

### Page-specific help

For each station, plan bare `?hybit` response:
- HAP's greeting for that specific station
- 3-5 suggestions relevant to that station
- Encourage exploration of other parameters

---

## Accessibility considerations

**Every station must have**:
- Skip link to main content
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)
- Alt text for all images
- ARIA labels on navigation
- Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for normal text
- Keyboard navigation support

**Code examples**:
- Use semantic HTML in examples
- Demonstrate accessible patterns
- Explain accessibility in HAP's voice
- Show before/after for accessibility improvements

---

## Performance targets

**Lighthouse scores for each station**:
- Performance: ≥99/100
- Accessibility: 100/100
- Best Practices: 100/100
- SEO: 100/100

**Optimization checklist**:
- All images have explicit width/height
- Below-fold images use `loading="lazy"`
- LCP image has `fetchpriority="high"`
- Scripts use `defer` attribute
- No layout shift (CLS = 0)
- CSS uses custom properties

---

## Next steps after planning

1. ✅ Complete this curriculum plan
2. ✅ Review "Unifying Project Concept" - Does it create cohesive learning journey?
3. ✅ Verify HAP voice examples are authentic
4. ✅ Check that each station builds on previous
5. ✅ Begin creating Station 1 HTML using `stations/_template-station.html`
6. ✅ Use Phase 1 improvements (example station, voice guidance, testing scripts)
7. ✅ Test iteratively (draft → review → refine)

**Remember**: This plan is your blueprint. Expect 2-3 hours per station to implement, with 2-3 rounds of iteration. That's normal and healthy!

---

**Total estimated time to complete all stations**: 12-18 hours
**Expected student completion time**: 6-8 hours
**Learning outcome**: Students build [YOUR FINAL PROJECT] with complete understanding of [YOUR TOPIC]
