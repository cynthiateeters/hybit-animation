                <p><strong>Welcome to Station 1!</strong> I spent hours trying to move elements with position and margin
                    before Prof. Teeters showed me transforms. I kept breaking my layouts — other elements would shift
                    around, creating gaps and overlaps everywhere. Then Prof. Teeters asked, "What if you could move
                    elements visually without affecting anything around them?" That question changed everything.
                    Transforms let me move, scale, and rotate elements while the document flow stays perfectly intact.
                    Let me share what I discovered! 🔬</p>

                    <p>I used to move elements with <code>position: relative</code> and margins, and everything around
                        them would shift. Prof. Teeters showed me that transforms move elements <em>visually</em>
                        without affecting the space they occupy in the layout. The element moves, but the layout stays
                        intact. This is the foundation of performant animation!</p>

                    <p>This confused me at first! In math class, Y goes <em>up</em>, but in browsers Y increases
                        <em>downward</em>. Prof. Teeters drew a diagram showing the origin at the top-left corner. X
                        increases to the right, Y increases down the page, and Z comes out of the screen toward you.
                        Understanding these axes is critical for predicting how transforms work.

                    <p>I was surprised when my first rotation happened from the <em>center</em> of the element, not the
                        top-left corner like I expected. Prof. Teeters explained that this is called the transform
                        origin, and it defaults to center because that's usually what creates the most natural-looking
                        effects. You can change it, but center is almost always what you want.</p>

                    <p>Before Prof. Teeters taught me about transforms, I tried moving elements by changing
                        <code>position: relative</code> with <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties, or by
                        adjusting margins. Every time I moved something, the entire layout would shift! Elements would
                        create gaps, overlap in weird ways, and I'd spend hours trying to fix all the side effects.
                        Prof. Teeters patiently explained that the <code>transform</code> property was designed
                        specifically for visual manipulation without layout disruption. When she showed me my first
                        <code>translateX()</code>, and <em>nothing else moved</em>, I finally understood the power of
                        transforms. It was like discovering a secret superpower!

                <p class="mb-2">The <code>transform</code> property allows you to visually manipulate elements — moving,
                    scaling, or rotating them in space — without affecting document flow or surrounding elements. This
                    is what makes transforms so powerful for animation!</p>

                        <p>Transforms move, scale, or rotate elements in space, but other elements stay in their
                            original positions. Only the transformed element appears to move. No reflows, no repaints of
                            surrounding content — which means better performance than changing position or dimensions.

                        <p>The X axis runs horizontally left to right. The Y axis runs vertically top to bottom (yes,
                            downward!). The Z axis runs toward and away from the viewer. The origin point is typically
                            the center of the element. This system is crucial for understanding how transforms work.</p>

                        <p>I tried using <code>position: relative</code> with margins to move a button, and the entire
                            layout broke. Other content shifted, creating gaps and overlaps everywhere. Prof. Teeters
                            showed me the <code>transform</code> property, and when I used my first
                            <code>translateX()</code>, I was amazed — the button moved, but <em>nothing else did</em>.
                            That's when I understood why transforms are special. They're designed specifically for
                            visual manipulation without layout consequences!

  /* Moves visually, layout stays intact */
}</code></pre>

                    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters explained that the first approach disrupts document flow, causing
                        reflows and repaints. The second approach moves the button visually while preserving its
                        original space in the layout. This is why transforms are the foundation for performant

                        Instant transforms are safe (they're not motion), but when we animate them in Station 2, we'll
                        need to respect user motion preferences. Building good habits now!</p>

                        <p>I spent an hour confused about <code>translate(50%, 0)</code>. I thought the percentage was
                            relative to the parent container's width, like with <code>width</code> or
                            <code>position</code>. Wrong! Prof. Teeters clarified that translate percentages are
                            relative to <em>the element's own size</em>. So a 100px wide element moved by
                            <code>translateX(50%)</code> moves 50px, not half the parent's width. This is different from
                            how percentages work with position!

                <p class="mb-2">Rotation spins elements in the 2D plane. Measured in degrees, positive values rotate
                    clockwise (like clock hands moving forward), and negative values rotate counterclockwise.</p>

                    <p class="code-comment mt-1">By default, rotation happens from the center of the element (not the
                        top-left corner like I initially expected). This is controlled by the
                        <code>transform-origin</code> property, which defaults to <code>center</code>.

                        <h3>HAP's observation about rotation</h3>
                        <p>I was surprised when my first <code>rotate(180deg)</code> flipped the element in place from
                            its center, not from the corner. Prof. Teeters explained that
                            <code>transform-origin: center</code> is the default, and it usually creates the most
                            natural-looking rotation. Try <code>transform-origin: top left</code> if you want to see the
                            difference — the element rotates around the top-left corner instead!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="mt-2">Combining transforms — order matters!</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">This is where it gets tricky! Transforms are applied sequentially from left to right,
                    and <strong>each transform modifies the coordinate system for the next one</strong>. Different
                    orders create completely different results.</p>

                        tried different values, changed the order, and spent time debugging.</p>

                    <p class="mt-1"><strong class="text-success">✅ What I learned from Prof. Teeters:</strong></p>
                    <p>She drew a diagram showing that after <code>rotate(90deg)</code>, the coordinate system rotates
                        with the element. The Y axis now points <em>horizontally</em>, not vertically! So
                        <code>translateY(100px)</code> moves along the new horizontal Y axis.
                    </p>

                        <div class="prompt-label">The order you choose changes everything:</div>
                        <pre><code class="language-css">/* Rotate THEN translate: Moves along rotated axis */
.box {
  transform: rotate(90deg) translateY(100px);
  /* Element moves to the RIGHT because Y axis rotated */
}

/* Translate THEN rotate: Moves first, rotates second */
.box {
  transform: translateY(100px) rotate(90deg);
  /* Element moves DOWN first, then rotates in place */
}</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters taught me to think step-by-step: visualize the coordinate system after
                        each transform. This systematic thinking is critical for predicting results!</p>

                    <p class="code-comment mt-1">The most common pattern I learned from Prof. Teeters: scale first (to
                        grow from center), rotate second (on the scaled element), translate last (to move the scaled and
                        rotated element). This creates natural lifting motion!</p>

                            it slightly. Finally, translation moves the already-scaled and rotated card upward. Each
                            transform builds on the previous one, creating a smooth, natural lifting effect!</p>

                        <h3>Transforms don't break layout</h3>
                        <p>Unlike position or margin, transforms preserve document flow. Your element moves visually but
                            nothing around it shifts. This is why transforms are perfect for animation — no layout
                            disruption means better performance and no unexpected side effects.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-number">2</div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Order matters when combining</h3>
                        <p>Transforms apply sequentially, and each one changes the coordinate system for the next.
                            Different orders create completely different results. Example:
                            <code>rotate(90deg) translateY(100px)</code> moves sideways because Y axis rotated!
                        </p>

                </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Think in coordinate systems</h3>
                        <p>Visualize the axes after each transform. X goes right, Y goes down, Z toward you. After
                            rotation, these axes rotate too. You must think step-by-step through the sequence to predict
                            the final result. Prof. Teeters taught me to visualize systematically.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Use translate for movement</h3>
                        <p>Translate is better than position or margin for animations. No layout disruption, no reflows,
                            smoother performance, and easier to combine with other transforms. It's the go-to choice for
                            moving elements, especially when animating.</p>
