                <p><strong>Welcome to Station 5!</strong> I was trying to create those bouncing loading dots like I saw on fancy websites, and I kept using transitions with different delays. But I could only get them to bounce once! I needed them to bounce up, then down, then pause, then repeat — that's way more than the two states transitions can handle. When I showed Prof. Teeters my frustrated attempts, she smiled and said, "HAP, you've hit the wall. Transitions are perfect for simple changes, but you need @keyframes for choreography." She introduced me to keyframe animations, and suddenly I could create complex multi-step sequences! The revelation: keyframes unlock a whole new level of animation control. Let me show you what I learned about when to use keyframes, how to build reusable patterns, and the critical rules for infinite loops! 🟠</p>

                    <p><strong>Use the simplest tool that works</strong></p>
                    <p>I kept trying to force transitions to do everything, even when I needed multi-step sequences. Prof. Teeters taught me her golden rule: transitions are perfect for two-state changes triggered by interaction (hover, focus, click), but keyframes are essential for choreographed multi-step animations like loading indicators, entrance effects, and complex sequences. I learned to ask myself: "Do I need more than a start and end state?" If yes, keyframes. If no, transitions. Choosing the right tool makes everything easier!</p>

                    <p><strong>Build a small library of core animations</strong></p>
                    <p>When Prof. Teeters showed me that keyframes are defined separately from elements, my mind exploded! I could write one @keyframes fadeIn animation and apply it to buttons, cards, modals, tooltips — anything! She taught me to build a small library of three essential patterns: entrance animations (fade in, slide in), exit animations (fade out, slide out), and attention animations (pulse, shake). Instead of writing unique animations for every element, I reuse the same proven patterns. Write once, use everywhere — that's efficiency!</p>

                    <p>I created my first spinner with animation-iteration-count: infinite and felt so proud — it spun forever! Then Prof. Teeters asked, "Did you add a pause button? Did you check prefers-reduced-motion?" I hadn't. She explained that infinite loops can cause nausea and dizziness for users with vestibular disorders. This became her strictest keyframes rule: if you use infinite, you MUST either provide pause controls or respect prefers-reduced-motion with a static alternative. The web must be safe for everyone. Infinite is powerful but requires responsibility!</p>

                    <h3>HAP's confession: keyframes looked intimidating</h3>
                    <p>When I first saw @keyframes syntax in documentation, I thought, "This looks way too complex for me!" The percentage markers, the nested properties, the animation shorthand with eight possible values — it felt overwhelming. I almost gave up before trying. But Prof. Teeters sat with me and explained it so simply: "HAP, percentages just tell a story over time. Zero percent is where you start. One hundred percent is where you end. Fifty percent is the middle of the journey. The browser smoothly fills in everything between." That clicked! I realized keyframes aren't complicated — they're just describing what happens at different moments. My first @keyframes fadeIn had only two states: 0% { opacity: 0; } and 100% { opacity: 1; }. That's it! Once I wrote that and saw it work, the intimidation vanished. Keyframes are actually simpler than they look. The syntax might seem foreign at first, but the concept is straightforward: describe your animation at key moments, and the browser handles the rest!</p>

                        <p>Prof. Teeters drilled this into me every time I reached for the wrong animation tool: transitions are perfect for two-state changes triggered by interaction (button hover, link underline, dropdown expansion). Keyframes are essential for multi-step sequences that need choreography (loading animations, entrance effects, complex movements). I learned to ask: "How many states do I need?" Two states? Transition. More than two? Keyframes. Use the simplest tool that accomplishes your goal. Overcomplicating with keyframes when a simple transition works is wasted effort. Prof. Teeters efficiency principle: choose wisely, build cleanly!</p>

                        <h3>Fill mode forwards for entrances</h3>
                        <p>This was my most common mistake, and Prof. Teeters corrected it constantly: animations snap back to their original state by default once they finish. If you fade something in from opacity: 0 to opacity: 1, it disappears again unless you add animation-fill-mode: forwards. I spent hours debugging entrance animations that "didn't work" before Prof. Teeters showed me this missing piece. Forwards tells the browser: "Keep the element in its final animated state." This is absolutely essential for fade-ins, slide-ins, and any entrance effect. Now it's automatic in my workflow — entrance animation? Add forwards. Exit animation? Forwards keeps it invisible. This one property saves so much frustration!</p>

                        <p>This is Prof. Teeters' strictest keyframes rule, and I understand why after learning about vestibular disorders: animation-iteration-count: infinite is powerful but dangerous if misused. Continuous motion can cause nausea, dizziness, and headaches for users with motion sensitivity. Never use infinite without one of two safety measures. Option 1: Provide a pause button that users can click to stop the animation (animation-play-state: paused). Option 2: Respect prefers-reduced-motion with a static alternative that preserves functionality. For loading spinners, show "Loading..." text instead. For bouncing dots, show static dots. The web must be safe for everyone. Infinite is not optional-safety, it's required-responsibility!</p>

                        <h3>Build a small reusable library</h3>
                        <p>Prof. Teeters taught me her minimalist approach that transformed how I work: most websites need only three core animation categories. Category 1: Entrance animations (fade in, slide in from various directions). Category 2: Exit animations (fade out, slide out). Category 3: Attention animations (gentle pulse, subtle shake, loading indicators). Instead of creating unique animations for every element, I built a small library of proven patterns and reuse them everywhere. One fadeIn keyframe animation works for modals, tooltips, notifications, cards — anything! This creates consistency across the site (every entrance feels similar), reduces code (define once, apply many times), and improves maintainability (update one keyframe, fix everywhere). Prof. Teeters wisdom: write once, use everywhere, maintain easily. Quality over quantity!</p>
