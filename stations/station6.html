        <p><strong>Welcome to Station 6!</strong> After learning all about transforms, transitions, timing, and
          keyframes, I was feeling pretty confident. Then I discovered that AI could help me write animation code in
          seconds instead of hours! I was so excited — I asked an AI for a button hover animation, got beautiful code
          back, and shipped it immediately. Then Prof. Teeters tested it and found a critical problem: no
          prefers-reduced-motion support. The animation violated accessibility guidelines! She sat me down and
          explained: "HAP, AI can generate code faster than you can type, but it doesn't care about your users the way
          you should. You own every line of code, whether you wrote it or AI did." That lesson changed how I work with
          AI completely. Let me show you what I learned about using AI responsibly for animations — the prompts that
          work, the verification that's mandatory, and the rules that keep users safe! 🟠</p>

          <p class="stat-large">2 hours → 5 minutes</p>
          <p><strong>Speed is only valuable when combined with quality</strong></p>
          <p>I used to spend hours writing animation code from scratch, carefully crafting each transition and
            keyframe. AI can generate that same code in seconds! But Prof. Teeters taught me the critical lesson: fast
            wrong code is completely useless. When I first started using AI, I got code instantly but had to spend hours
            fixing accessibility and performance issues — that's not actually faster. The breakthrough came when I
            learned to request accessibility and performance in my prompts upfront, then verify the output before using
            it. Now my workflow is: detailed prompt (2 minutes) + AI generation (10 seconds) + verification testing (3
            minutes) = production-ready code in 5 minutes. Speed plus validation equals true efficiency!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <h3><span class="insight-icon">🎯</span> Better prompts, better code</h3>
          <p class="stat-large stat-teal">Vague → Specific</p>
          <p><strong>Detailed prompts produce professional results</strong></p>
          <p>My first AI prompt was embarrassingly simple: "Make this button animate on hover." The AI gave me generic
            code that used transition: all (bad for performance), forgot prefers-reduced-motion (accessibility
            violation), and had no keyboard focus state (usability problem). Totally unusable! Prof. Teeters showed me
            how professionals write prompts: explicitly request transform and opacity only (GPU-optimized), specify
            ease-out timing (responsive feel), require prefers-reduced-motion support (accessibility), include keyboard
            focus states (usability), and use hsl() colors (maintainability). When I wrote detailed prompts with all
            these requirements, AI suddenly gave me production-ready code! The difference between vague and specific
            prompts is the difference between hours of fixing and code that works immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <h3><span class="insight-icon">✅</span> You own the code</h3>
          <p class="stat-large stat-brown">AI generates, you're accountable</p>
          <p><strong>Verification is not optional</strong></p>
          <p>This is Prof. Teeters' strictest rule about AI, and I learned it the hard way. When I shipped that button
            animation without testing it properly, I thought, "AI wrote it, so it must be correct!" Wrong. Dead wrong.
            Prof. Teeters made it crystal clear: whether I typed the code myself or AI generated it, I am responsible
            for every single line. If it violates accessibility guidelines, that's my failure. If it stutters on mobile
            devices, that's my problem. If users with vestibular disorders get sick from my animations, that's on me,
            not the AI. Understanding this changed my entire workflow — now I read every line of AI-generated code,
            test accessibility with DevTools, verify performance on mobile, and only ship code I fully comprehend. AI
            is my assistant, not my replacement. I own the code!</p>

          <h3>HAP's confession: I copied code without reading it</h3>
          <p>I have to share my most embarrassing AI mistake because it taught me the most important lesson about
            working with AI. When I first discovered AI could write animation code, I went wild. I asked it for button
            hovers, card animations, notification slides — all kinds of effects. The code looked beautiful and worked
            perfectly in my browser! I copied it all directly into my project without reading a single line. Why would
            I need to read it? AI is smart, right? I shipped everything to production feeling so proud of how fast I
            worked.</p>
          <p class="mt-1">A week later, Prof. Teeters sent me a devastating message: "HAP, I tested your animation
            library on my accessibility testing device. Every single animation violates WCAG guidelines. No
            prefers-reduced-motion support anywhere. You just made the site unusable for people with vestibular
            disorders." I felt absolutely horrible. Real users were potentially getting sick because I blindly trusted
            AI and skipped verification. Prof. Teeters didn't yell — she just looked disappointed and said quietly,
            "Speed without responsibility isn't efficiency, HAP. It's carelessness."</p>
          <p class="mt-1">That was my wake-up call. I went back through every AI-generated animation, read every line
            of code, added proper accessibility features, and tested everything thoroughly. It took three days to fix
            what I thought I'd finished in three hours. The lesson burned into my memory: AI is an incredibly powerful
            tool for generating code quickly, but verification is absolutely mandatory. I will never again ship code I
            don't understand, whether I wrote it or AI did. My name goes on that code — my responsibility goes with it!

        <h2>What AI can and can't do</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">When I first started using AI for animations, I had unrealistic expectations. I thought AI could
          handle everything perfectly — just describe what I wanted and get flawless code! Prof. Teeters quickly taught
          me that wasn't how it worked. She sat me down and explained: "HAP, AI has remarkable strengths for certain
          tasks, but serious weaknesses for others. Understanding these boundaries is essential for using AI
          effectively." Learning what AI excels at and what it struggles with transformed how I work with it. Instead of
          being frustrated by AI's limitations, I learned to leverage its strengths while compensating for its
          weaknesses.</p>

                and structure are AI's specialty</li>
              <li><strong>Converting timing values between units:</strong> Need to convert 300ms to seconds or

                cubic-bezier curves and animation-fill-mode with excellent clarity</li>

            <h3>HAP's takeaway: AI as teacher and assistant</h3>
            <p>One day I was completely confused about cubic-bezier timing functions. I'd read the documentation three
              times and still didn't get how the four numbers worked together. Out of frustration, I asked AI to explain
              it to me like I was five years old. The explanation was brilliant! AI walked me through how the control
              points work, gave me visual analogies, and helped me finally understand the concept. I was amazed — AI is
              an incredible teacher for technical concepts!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">But then I asked AI to generate a spinner animation, and it gave me beautiful code with one
              massive problem: no prefers-reduced-motion support. Again. For the tenth time that week. I realized AI has
              this strange split personality — excellent at explaining concepts but terrible at remembering
              accessibility. Prof. Teeters helped me understand why: "AI is trained on millions of code examples, and
              most of those examples don't include accessibility. It's learned the patterns of typical code, which sadly
              means incomplete code."</p>
            <p class="mt-1">That's when it clicked for me. AI isn't a replacement for my knowledge — it's a partner that
              needs clear rules. When I set boundaries (always request accessibility, always specify GPU properties,
              always ask for semantic naming), AI becomes incredibly valuable. The key is treating AI like a talented but
              forgetful colleague who needs specific instructions to do great work!</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Creating Button Hover Animations with AI -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="topic-section">
        <h2>Creating button hover animations with AI</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">Button hover animations were one of the first things I tried to create with AI. It seemed
          perfect — a simple, common pattern that AI should handle easily! But my early attempts were disasters. The
          code looked fine at first glance, but it violated performance and accessibility guidelines. Prof. Teeters used
          my failed button animations to teach me the most important lesson about AI: the quality of AI output depends
          entirely on the quality of your prompt. Vague requests get vague results. Detailed prompts with specific
          requirements get production-ready code.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Before I learned to write good prompts</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">My first attempt was embarrassingly simple. I just asked AI: "Make this button animate on
          hover." That's it. No requirements, no constraints, no mention of accessibility or performance. Here's what AI
          gave me:</p>

        <div class="warning-box mt-2">
          <h3>❌ Vague prompt produces unusable code</h3>
          <p><strong>My vague prompt:</strong></p>
          <div class="prompt-box mt-1">
            <div class="prompt-label">What I asked AI:</div>
            <pre><code class="language-text">Make this button animate on hover.</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p class="mt-2"><strong>What AI generated:</strong></p>
          <pre><code class="language-css">/* Generic AI output without proper constraints */
.button {
  background: #3366cc; /* ❌ Hex colors instead of hsl() */
  padding: 12px 24px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: all 0.3s; /* ❌ 'all' is bad for performance */
}

.button:hover {
  background: #4477dd;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  /* ❌ No prefers-reduced-motion support */
  /* ❌ No keyboard focus state */
  /* ❌ Animating box-shadow (CPU-bound) */
}</code></pre>

          <p class="mt-1"><strong>Problems with this code:</strong></p>
          <ul class="mt-1">
            <li><strong>Uses transition: all</strong> — Animates every property change, terrible for performance</li>
            <li><strong>No accessibility support</strong> — Missing prefers-reduced-motion media query completely</li>
            <li><strong>No keyboard focus state</strong> — Only works for mouse users, excluding keyboard navigation</li>
            <li><strong>Hex colors</strong> — Harder to maintain than hsl() format</li>
            <li><strong>Animates box-shadow</strong> — CPU-bound property that can stutter on mobile devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-1">This code is completely unusable for production. I'd have to spend time fixing all these
            issues — defeating the purpose of using AI!</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The prompt I learned to write</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters showed me how to write prompts that include all the requirements upfront. Instead
          of letting AI guess what I need, I tell it exactly what standards to follow. Here's the detailed prompt that
          produces professional code:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ Detailed prompt with all requirements:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Create a button hover animation with these requirements:
- Use transform and opacity only (GPU-optimized)
- Duration: 300ms with ease-out timing
- Include prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Add keyboard focus state with same animation
- Use hsl() color format for consistency
- Lift button slightly on hover (translateY)
- Provide complete CSS including base styles</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">What AI generates with a good prompt</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">When I include all those requirements, AI produces code that's actually production-ready. Look
          at the difference:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ AI output with detailed constraints:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-css">/* Professional AI output with proper constraints */
.button {
  background: hsl(210, 70%, 50%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 12px 24px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;

  /* Only animate GPU-accelerated properties */
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 1;
  transition: transform 300ms ease-out, opacity 300ms ease-out;
}

.button:hover,
.button:focus-visible {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  opacity: 0.9;
}

/* Accessibility: respect reduced motion preference */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .button {
    transition: none;
  }

  .button:hover,
  .button:focus-visible {
    transform: none;
    opacity: 0.85; /* Subtle change only */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>Why this code is better:</strong> Uses hsl() colors, animates only
            transform and opacity (GPU-accelerated), includes prefers-reduced-motion support, has keyboard focus state
            with :focus-visible, uses ease-out timing (responsive feel), and provides complete accessible implementation.

            <h3>HAP's reflection: Learning to write better prompts</h3>
            <p>I'll be honest — my first few weeks with AI were frustrating. I kept getting code that looked good but
              had serious problems. I'd ask for a button animation and get code using transition: all. I'd ask for a
              card hover effect and get code with no accessibility support. Every time, I had to spend hours fixing what
              AI generated. I started thinking AI was useless for animations!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Then Prof. Teeters sat down with me and looked at my prompts. She laughed (kindly!) and
              said, "HAP, you're asking AI to read your mind! You want GPU-optimized properties, but you didn't mention
              that. You need accessibility, but you didn't request it. You expect ease-out timing, but you didn't
              specify it. AI can't guess what you know from Stations 1-5 — you have to tell it!"</p>
            <p class="mt-1">That changed everything. I started writing prompts that included every requirement: use
              transform and opacity only, include prefers-reduced-motion, add keyboard focus states, use hsl() colors,
              specify ease-out timing. Suddenly AI gave me perfect code on the first try! The breakthrough wasn't AI
              getting smarter — it was me learning to communicate my requirements clearly. Detailed prompts transformed
              AI from frustrating to invaluable!</p>

        <p class="mb-2">After I learned to write good prompts for transitions, I thought keyframes would be the same.
          Just add more detail, right? Wrong! Keyframes are significantly more complex than transitions — they require
          naming conventions, percentage markers, fill modes, and careful timing coordination. My first keyframes prompts
          were too vague, and AI made assumptions that didn't match what I needed. Prof. Teeters taught me that keyframes
          prompts need even more specificity than transition prompts. You have to describe not just what animates, but
          also the exact sequence, the timing progression, and how the animation should behave after it completes.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The task: notification slide-in animation</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">I needed a notification banner that slides in from the right side of the screen when a user
          completes an action. The notification should start off-screen (translateX 100%), fade in while sliding, and
          then stay visible after the animation completes. This is a perfect use case for keyframes — a choreographed
          entrance that transitions can't handle.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">My effective keyframes prompt</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Here's the detailed prompt I learned to write for keyframes animations. Notice how much more
          specific it is compared to transition prompts — I have to describe the entire sequence:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ Effective keyframes prompt with complete requirements:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Create a notification slide-in animation with these requirements:
- Use @keyframes named "slideInNotification"
- Animate from translateX(100%) and opacity: 0 to translateX(0) and opacity: 1
- Apply with animation-fill-mode: forwards so it stays visible
- Duration: 400ms with ease-out timing
- Include prefers-reduced-motion media query with instant appearance
- Provide context: This is for success/error notifications
- Use only transform and opacity (GPU-optimized)
- Provide complete CSS including application to .notification class</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">AI-generated keyframes code</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">With this detailed prompt, AI generates professional keyframes code that's ready to use. Look at
          how complete and well-structured this output is:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ Professional keyframes animation from AI:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-css">/* Notification slide-in animation */
@keyframes slideInNotification {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.notification {
  /* Position notification fixed to viewport */
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;

  /* Styling */
  background: hsl(140, 70%, 50%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 16px 24px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.15);

  /* Apply animation */
  animation: slideInNotification 400ms ease-out forwards;
}

/* Accessibility: respect reduced motion preference */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .notification {
    animation: none;
    /* Appears instantly at final position */
    transform: translateX(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>Why this code is excellent:</strong> Semantic naming
            (slideInNotification), uses only GPU-accelerated properties (transform and opacity), includes
            animation-fill-mode: forwards to keep final state, provides complete styling and positioning, includes
            prefers-reduced-motion with instant appearance, uses hsl() colors throughout, and has ease-out timing for
            responsive feel. This is production-ready code!</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">How to apply this pattern</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Once AI generates this keyframes animation, I can trigger it by adding the .notification class
          to an element when needed. The beauty of keyframes is that the animation definition is reusable — I can apply
          slideInNotification to different elements:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">Applying the animation with JavaScript:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Show success notification
function showNotification(message, type) {
  const notification = document.createElement('div');
  notification.className = 'notification';
  notification.textContent = message;
  document.body.appendChild(notification);

  // Remove after 5 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    notification.remove();
  }, 5000);
}</code></pre>

            <h3>HAP's learning: Keyframes need comprehensive prompts</h3>
            <p>My first keyframes prompt was terrible: "Create a slide-in animation for notifications." That's it. AI had
              to guess everything — from which direction to slide, to what properties to animate, to whether it should
              loop or run once. The code AI generated worked, but it wasn't what I needed! It slid from the top instead of
              the right. It used margin-left instead of transform. It didn't include fill-mode, so the notification
              snapped back to its starting position after animating. It was completely wrong!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters looked at my prompt and said, "HAP, you gave AI one sentence and expected it to
              read your mind about eight different decisions. Keyframes have so many options — direction, properties,
              timing, fill-mode, iteration-count, naming. You have to specify what you want for each one!" She taught me
              to think through the entire animation sequence before writing the prompt: What's the starting state? What's
              the ending state? Should it stay at the end or reset? What's the timing? What about accessibility?</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Once I started writing comprehensive prompts with every detail specified, AI became incredibly
              helpful for keyframes! I'd get perfect boilerplate in seconds. The key lesson: keyframes complexity requires
              prompt comprehensiveness. Don't ask AI to guess — tell it exactly what you need!</p>

    <!-- Section 5: AI for Animation Accessibility -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="topic-section">
        <h2>AI for animation accessibility</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">This is where AI fails most consistently, and it's the most important issue to understand.
          Accessibility isn't a nice-to-have feature — it's a fundamental requirement that protects users with
          vestibular disorders from physical harm. When I first started using AI for animations, I was shocked to
          discover that AI forgets prefers-reduced-motion support in nearly every single response unless I explicitly
          request it. Prof. Teeters made this her strictest rule: <strong>Never trust AI to include accessibility on its
            own. You must request it explicitly in every prompt, then verify it manually every single time.</strong> This
          isn't being paranoid — it's being professional.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The problem: AI constantly forgets accessibility</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">I learned this lesson the hard way. I asked AI to generate five different animations for a
          project — button hovers, card transitions, notification slides, loading spinners, and modal entrances. The code
          looked beautiful! Every animation was smooth, well-structured, and used proper syntax. I was so proud of how
          quickly I'd built this animation library.</p>

        <p class="mt-1">Then Prof. Teeters tested my work with accessibility tools enabled. Every single animation
          violated WCAG guidelines. Not one animation had prefers-reduced-motion support. Users who experience dizziness,
          nausea, or seizures from motion would have been harmed by my animations. I felt terrible. Prof. Teeters sat me
          down and explained: "AI is trained on millions of code examples, and most developers don't include
          accessibility. AI learned to write code the way most people write it — incomplete and harmful to vulnerable
          users."</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The solution: Make accessibility explicit in every prompt</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Here's the accessibility-focused prompt template I now use for every single animation request to
          AI:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ Accessibility-first prompt template:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Create [animation description] with these CRITICAL accessibility requirements:

MANDATORY accessibility features:
- Include @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) media query
- Provide instant state changes as alternative (animation: none)
- Ensure functionality is preserved without motion
- For infinite animations: add pause controls OR respect reduced-motion
- Test that the experience makes sense without motion

[Then add your other technical requirements...]</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Before and after: Accessibility comparison</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Here's a perfect example of the problem. This is what AI gives me without accessibility in the
          prompt:</p>

        <div class="warning-box mt-2">

        </div>

        <p class="mt-2">Now here's what AI generates when I explicitly request accessibility:</p>

            <h3>HAP's accessibility checklist: Non-negotiable rules</h3>
            <p>After my accessibility failure, I created a systematic checklist that I follow for every single AI-generated
              animation. These rules are non-negotiable — I never skip them, no matter how rushed I am:</p>
            <ul class="mt-1">
              <li><strong>Always include "prefers-reduced-motion" in the prompt</strong> — Never assume AI will remember
              </li>
              <li><strong>Test with DevTools emulation</strong> — Enable reduced motion setting and verify it works</li>
              <li><strong>Verify the static alternative makes sense</strong> — Does the page work without motion?</li>
              <li><strong>Check that functionality is preserved</strong> — Users shouldn't lose features due to reduced
                motion</li>
              <li><strong>For infinite animations, provide pause controls</strong> — Or respect reduced-motion completely
              </li>
              <li><strong>Read the @media query code</strong> — Don't trust AI got it right, verify yourself</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters made this crystal clear: "HAP, accessibility isn't a suggestion. It's a
              requirement. Users with vestibular disorders deserve the same access to web experiences as everyone else. AI
              won't protect them — you have to." That lesson is now the foundation of my entire AI workflow. I request
              accessibility first, implement it correctly, and test it thoroughly. Every. Single. Time.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: Optimizing Animation Performance with AI -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="topic-section">
        <h2>Optimizing animation performance with AI</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">Performance is another area where AI needs explicit guidance. AI knows about GPU-accelerated
          properties in theory, but it doesn't prioritize them unless you specifically request optimization. I learned
          this when I built an animation that worked beautifully on my desktop computer but stuttered badly on Prof.
          Teeters' phone. AI had used CPU-bound properties like margin and width instead of GPU-accelerated transform and
          opacity. The lesson: AI can help optimize performance, but only if you tell it performance is a priority.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Remembering the GPU "fast lane" from Station 2</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">In Station 2, Prof. Teeters taught me about the GPU "fast lane" for transform and opacity. These
          properties get special graphics-card acceleration that makes animations silky smooth, even on slower devices.
          When I animate width, margin, or position properties instead, the browser has to recalculate the entire page
          layout on every frame — and that stutters on mobile! Now I needed to teach AI to follow the same rule.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The challenge: Animation stuttering on mobile</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">I created a card animation that expanded when clicked. My first version worked perfectly on my
          laptop — smooth, responsive, professional. Then I tested it on Prof. Teeters' older phone and it was janky! The
          animation stuttered and felt sluggish. I checked the code and realized the problem: I'd asked AI for a "card
          expansion animation" without specifying performance requirements. AI generated code using width and height
          properties (CPU-bound) instead of transform: scale (GPU-accelerated).</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">The performance-focused prompt</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Here's how I learned to request performance optimization explicitly:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ Performance optimization prompt:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Optimize this animation for mobile performance with these requirements:

Performance constraints:
- Use ONLY transform and opacity (GPU-accelerated properties)
- NO margin, padding, width, height, top, left, right, bottom (CPU-bound)
- Explain why your choices are performant
- Keep animation duration under 300ms for responsiveness
- Ensure smooth playback on devices with 60fps displays

[Then describe the animation you need...]</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Before and after: Performance comparison</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Here's the dramatic difference between CPU-bound and GPU-optimized code:</p>

        <div class="warning-box mt-2">
          <h3>❌ CPU-bound animation (stutters on mobile)</h3>
          <pre><code class="language-css">/* Card expansion - CPU-bound properties */
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  margin: 20px;
  transition: width 300ms ease-out, height 300ms ease-out;
}

.card.expanded {
  width: 400px;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 10px;
  /* ❌ Animating width/height triggers layout recalculation */
  /* ❌ Animating margin shifts surrounding elements */
  /* ❌ Browser must recalculate entire page layout every frame */
  /* ❌ Stutters on mobile devices */
}</code></pre>
          <p class="mt-1"><strong>Why this stutters:</strong> Width, height, and margin are layout properties. Changing
            them forces the browser to recalculate positions of all surrounding elements on every animation frame. This
            work happens on the CPU's main thread, which gets overwhelmed on mobile devices.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-2">Now here's the GPU-optimized version that AI generates when I request performance explicitly:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">✅ GPU-optimized animation (smooth on mobile)</div>
          <pre><code class="language-css">/* Card expansion - GPU-accelerated properties */
.card {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  transform: scale(1);
  opacity: 1;
  transition: transform 300ms ease-out, opacity 300ms ease-out;
}

.card.expanded {
  transform: scale(1.33);
  opacity: 0.95;
  /* ✅ Transform happens on GPU's graphics pipeline */
  /* ✅ No layout recalculation needed */
  /* ✅ Surrounding elements unaffected */
  /* ✅ Smooth on all devices, including older phones */
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card {
    transition: none;
  }
  .card.expanded {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>Why this is smooth:</strong> Transform and opacity are GPU-accelerated
            properties that run on a separate graphics thread. The browser doesn't need to recalculate layout or paint —
            it just composites the pre-rendered element at a different scale. This works smoothly even on low-powered
            mobile devices!</p>

            <h3>HAP's performance rule: Always test on mobile</h3>
            <p>Prof. Teeters has a testing ritual that I've adopted: she never approves an animation until I've tested it
              on her phone. Not my phone — her phone. It's a few years old and doesn't have the latest processor. If my
              animation runs smoothly on her phone, it'll run smoothly anywhere. If it stutters, I know I'm using
              CPU-bound properties.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">This ritual taught me that AI doesn't think about mobile performance by default. AI optimizes
              for "works correctly" not "works smoothly on slow devices." When I ask AI for an animation without
              mentioning performance, it often suggests margin, width, height, or position properties because they're
              easier to understand and produce more obvious visual changes. But those properties destroy mobile
              performance!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Now my workflow is simple: explicitly request transform and opacity only, explicitly forbid
              margin/width/height/position, and test on Prof. Teeters' phone before shipping. That combination ensures my
              AI-generated animations are accessible AND performant. Both requirements are non-negotiable!</p>

    <!-- Section 8: HAP's Rules for Working with AI -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="tips-container">
        <h2 class="section-heading-centered">HAP's rules for working with AI</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">After months of working with AI for animations, I've developed six non-negotiable rules. These
          aren't suggestions — they're requirements that Prof. Teeters approves and enforces. Following these rules is
          the difference between AI being helpful versus AI being harmful.</p>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">1</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Always request accessibility</h3>
            <p>Never assume AI will include accessibility features on its own. Explicitly request prefers-reduced-motion
              support in every single prompt. Ask for pause controls when needed. Request keyboard accessibility states.
              This isn't optional — it's Prof. Teeters' strictest rule. AI learned from millions of code examples that
              don't include accessibility, so it forgets unless you remind it every time. Make accessibility the first
              requirement in your prompts, not an afterthought.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">2</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Specify performance constraints</h3>
            <p>Explicitly request transform and opacity only. Mention GPU acceleration when you prompt. Specify which
              properties to avoid (margin, width, height, position). Ask for mobile-friendly code that runs smoothly on
              60fps displays. Performance isn't automatic — AI prioritizes "works correctly" over "works smoothly on slow
              devices." If you don't mention performance, AI will suggest easy properties like margin and width that
              destroy mobile performance. Make performance constraints explicit!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">3</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Provide context and purpose</h3>
            <p>Explain what the animation is for (error notification, success message, loading indicator). Mention your
              brand personality (playful, professional, energetic). Describe user expectations for this interaction. Give
              timing preferences based on urgency. Context dramatically improves AI's decisions! When AI knows an error
              notification should feel urgent (200ms, sharp timing) versus a success message should feel celebratory
              (400ms, bouncy easing), it makes better choices. Don't just describe the technical requirements — explain
              the "why" behind the animation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">4</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Use detailed specific prompts</h3>
            <p>List all technical requirements upfront (properties, duration, timing function, fill-mode). Include
              accessibility constraints explicitly. Mention performance needs (GPU properties only). Specify exact
              approaches you want (use keyframes not transitions, use ease-out not linear). Detailed prompts save time —
              they get you production-ready code on the first attempt instead of code you have to fix. Vague prompts force
              AI to guess, and its guesses rarely match professional standards. Spend two minutes crafting a comprehensive
              prompt to save two hours of fixing!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">5</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Verify everything before using</h3>
            <p>Read every line of generated code before copying it. Test accessibility manually with DevTools
              prefers-reduced-motion emulation. Check performance on mobile devices (preferably older phones). Validate
              against concepts learned in Stations 1-5. Never trust AI output blindly — verification is mandatory! AI
              generates code in seconds, but you're responsible for every line forever. If it breaks, causes accessibility
              violations, or performs poorly, that's your failure, not AI's. Verification isn't optional.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
          <div class="tip-number">6</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Understand before shipping</h3>
            <p>You must comprehend every line of AI-generated code. If you don't understand why it works, you can't debug
              when problems arise. You can't modify code you don't comprehend. Knowledge beats speed — shipping code you
              understand is better than shipping code quickly. Prof. Teeters taught me that understanding is what
              separates professionals from code copiers. AI can generate animations, but you need to know why the timing
              works, why ease-out feels right, why transform is performant. That knowledge makes you valuable, not the
              code itself.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: Advanced Prompt Strategies -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="topic-section">
        <h2>Advanced prompt strategies</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">Real AI collaboration isn't one-shot perfection — it's conversational refinement. I learned that
          the best results come from treating AI like a colleague I'm working with, not a magic wand I wave once. These
          advanced prompts help me iterate, troubleshoot, and refine AI output safely. Prof. Teeters calls this
          "conversational refinement" and it's how professionals actually work with AI.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Iteration prompt for refinement</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Use this when the code works but doesn't quite feel right. Maybe the timing is too slow, the
          easing is too sharp, or the effect is too subtle. This prompt helps you refine while preserving what's already
          correct:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">Refinement prompt:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Revise this animation code. Keep the same technical approach
(transform/opacity, prefers-reduced-motion) but adjust the timing
to feel more [snappy/smooth/gentle] for a [context: e.g., error notification].

Current code:
[paste the code AI generated]

Make it feel more urgent without breaking accessibility or performance.</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>When to use this:</strong> When technical requirements are met but
            aesthetic feel needs adjustment. Perfect for refining timing and easing to match brand personality while
            keeping accessibility and performance intact.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Troubleshooting prompt for problems</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Use this when something isn't working correctly. AI is surprisingly good at debugging when you
          describe the specific problem you're experiencing:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">Debugging prompt:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">This animation doesn't work correctly: [describe issue].

Current code:
[paste the problematic code]

Explain what might be wrong with the current implementation,
then provide a corrected version that maintains accessibility
and performance requirements.

Specific problem: The card doesn't stay in its final position
after the animation completes.</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>When to use this:</strong> When you spot a bug or unexpected behavior. AI
            will often identify issues like missing fill-mode, incorrect timing functions, or conflicting properties. But
            always verify the fix yourself — understand the root cause!</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Safety prompt for production code</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Use this when refactoring existing code that's already working in production. This prompt ensures
          nothing critical breaks during changes:</p>

        <div class="prompt-box mt-2">
          <div class="prompt-label">Safe refactoring prompt:</div>
          <pre><code class="language-text">Refactor this animation without breaking existing functionality.
Preserve all:
- Accessibility features (reduced-motion, keyboard focus)
- Performance optimizations (GPU properties)
- Class names and IDs (JavaScript may reference them)
- Visual appearance (timing, easing, distances)

Current code:
[paste existing working code]

Goal: Convert from transitions to keyframes while maintaining
everything that currently works.</code></pre>
          <p class="code-comment mt-1"><strong>When to use this:</strong> When improving or modernizing code that users
            depend on. Ensures you don't accidentally remove accessibility, break JavaScript dependencies, or change
            visual behavior unexpectedly.</p>

          <div class="hap-note-content">
            <h3>HAP's workflow evolution: From one-shot to conversational</h3>
            <p>Early on, I treated AI like a vending machine: insert prompt, get code, done. If the first result wasn't
              perfect, I'd get frustrated and start over with a completely new prompt. This was exhausting and
              inefficient!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters watched me struggle and said, "HAP, you're treating AI like it's supposed to
              read your mind on the first try. Real collaboration is iterative. Give AI your requirements, see what it
              produces, then refine based on what you learn. It's a conversation, not a transaction." That completely
              changed my approach!</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Now my workflow is: detailed initial prompt → review output → identify what's good and what
              needs adjustment → refinement prompt focusing on specific issues → verify → ship. I might iterate 2-3
              times, but each iteration is targeted and quick. The total time is still faster than writing from scratch,
              and the final code is better because I've refined it thoughtfully. Treating AI as a conversational partner
              instead of a magic solution makes all the difference!</p>

    <!-- Section 10: When NOT to Use AI -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <div class="topic-section">
        <h2>When NOT to use AI</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">AI is powerful for animations, but it's not always the right tool. Prof. Teeters taught me to
          recognize situations where manual work is better than AI assistance. Using AI when you shouldn't is worse than
          not using AI at all — it creates dependencies on tools for things you should understand deeply yourself.
          Understanding when NOT to use AI is just as important as knowing when to use it.</p>

        <div class="analysis-grid mt-2">
          <div class="analysis-point">
            <h3>When you're still learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Don't use AI for concepts you don't understand yet.</strong> If you're still learning how
              keyframes work, don't let AI write them for you. Do it manually first to build understanding, then use AI
              for repetition once you comprehend the fundamentals. Prof. Teeters put it perfectly: "You can't verify what
              you don't understand. You can't debug what you didn't learn. AI should accelerate your knowledge, not
              replace it."</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Practice animations manually through Stations 1-5 first. Once you know why ease-out feels
              responsive, why transform is performant, and why prefers-reduced-motion is mandatory, then AI becomes
              valuable for speed. But skip the learning and AI just makes you dependent without building capability.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="analysis-point">
            <h3>When timing must match brand</h3>
            <p><strong>AI doesn't understand brand personality.</strong> Should your button hover feel playful and bouncy
              or professional and subtle? That's a design judgment requiring human intuition. AI makes generic choices —
              it suggests 300ms ease-out for everything because that's statistically common. But your brand might need
              200ms linear for urgency, or 500ms ease-in-out for luxury.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Use AI to generate the technical structure, but adjust timing and easing yourself based on
              brand personality. AI can write the syntax, but you have to provide the soul. Context-specific timing
              decisions need your judgment, not AI's statistical averages.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="analysis-point">
            <h3>When accessibility is critical</h3>
            <p><strong>Never trust AI for accessibility alone.</strong> Always verify reduced motion implementation
              manually. Check that alternatives work properly. Test with real accessibility tools. Even when you explicitly
              request accessibility in prompts, AI sometimes gets it wrong — missing edge cases, providing incomplete
              alternatives, or suggesting patterns that don't actually preserve functionality.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">AI can generate the @media query syntax, but you must verify it works correctly for users.
              Test with DevTools emulation. Verify the static alternative makes sense. Ensure functionality is preserved
              without motion. Accessibility verification is your responsibility — AI can assist, but you must validate.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="warning-box mt-3">
          <h3>🟠 Prof. Teeters' warning about AI and learning</h3>
          <p class="mt-1"><strong>"AI is a tool for saving time, not for skipping understanding."</strong></p>
          <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters shared this warning after watching me rely too heavily on AI early in my learning:
            "HAP, learning cannot be automated. You can't outsource understanding to AI and expect to become skilled. AI
            should accelerate work you already comprehend, not replace the work of learning. If you let AI write all your
            animations before you understand why they work, you become dependent on a tool instead of capable as a
            developer."</p>
          <p class="mt-1">She's right. The knowledge I gained from Stations 1-5 is what makes AI collaboration valuable. I
            know what to ask for because I understand transforms, transitions, timing, micro-interactions, and keyframes.
            AI can't teach you those fundamentals — you have to learn them yourself. Then AI becomes incredibly powerful
            for applying that knowledge quickly. But skip the learning and AI just produces code you can't debug, modify,
            or improve.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Quick reference: AI animation tasks</h2>
      <p class="mt-1">Not every animation task is equally suitable for AI assistance. I learned to evaluate each task
        based on AI's strengths and limitations. This grid shows you what to expect from AI for different animation
        tasks and what verification steps are critical:</p>

      <div class="overview-grid mt-2">
        <div class="insight-card">

          <p class="stat-large">AI Use: Excellent</p>
          <p><strong>Review step: Check accessibility included</strong></p>
          <p>AI excels at generating clean animation syntax for transitions and keyframes. Give it specific
            requirements (properties, duration, timing), and it produces proper code quickly. However, always verify it
            included prefers-reduced-motion support — AI sometimes forgets this critical accessibility feature!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <h3><span class="insight-icon">✅</span> Create keyframes boilerplate</h3>
          <p class="stat-large stat-teal">AI Use: Excellent</p>
          <p><strong>Review step: Verify naming and structure</strong></p>
          <p>AI is fantastic for generating @keyframes boilerplate with proper percentages and properties. Especially
            useful for complex multi-step sequences. Just verify the naming is semantic (slideInNotification not
            animation1) and the structure follows best practices you learned in Station 5!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-card">
          <h3><span class="insight-icon">✅</span> Optimize for performance</h3>
          <p class="stat-large stat-green">AI Use: Good with guidance</p>
          <p><strong>Review step: Confirm GPU properties only</strong></p>
          <p>AI can help optimize animations for performance, but only if you explicitly request it. Ask specifically
            for transform and opacity only, and tell it to avoid margin, width, height, and position properties. Then
            verify the output actually uses GPU-accelerated properties — AI sometimes suggests CPU-bound alternatives!

          <p><strong>Review step: Always verify manually</strong></p>
          <p>AI frequently forgets accessibility unless explicitly prompted. You MUST request prefers-reduced-motion
            support in every single prompt — never assume AI will include it. After generation, always test with
            DevTools reduced motion emulation to verify the static alternative actually works!</p>

          <p><strong>Review step: Adjust to feel right</strong></p>
          <p>AI can suggest timing values, but it doesn't understand your brand personality. Is your brand playful
            (bouncy, longer durations) or professional (subtle, 200-300ms)? AI makes generic choices. Use its generated
            code as a starting point, then adjust timing and easing to match your brand's character!</p>

          <p><strong>Review step: Make decision yourself</strong></p>
          <p>AI cannot judge whether animation is actually necessary or helpful. Does this UI change need motion, or
            would instant feedback be better? Prof. Teeters taught me that restraint is a design skill, not a technical
            one. AI will happily animate everything if you ask — you need to decide what deserves motion!</p>

          <p><strong>Review step: Must test manually</strong></p>
          <p>AI can write the @media (prefers-reduced-motion) code, but it cannot test whether the static alternative
            actually works for users. You must test this manually using DevTools emulation, verify functionality is
            preserved without motion, and ensure the experience makes sense. Testing is your responsibility!</p>

          <p>AI is surprisingly helpful when debugging! Describe what's wrong ("animation stutters on mobile," "doesn't
            work in Safari"), and AI often suggests useful solutions. But always understand the root cause yourself —

          <h3>Prof. Teeters on completing all six stations</h3>
          <p><strong>"HAP, you've come so far from that confused robot asking basic questions about transforms!"</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters smiled when I finished this last station. "You started at Station 1 not knowing
            the difference between translate and transition. Now you can build accessible, performant animations and
            even collaborate responsibly with AI tools! But here's what I'm most proud of: you understand that
            knowledge from Stations 1-5 is what makes AI collaboration valuable. AI can only help you build animations
            well because you know what 'well' means. You learned transforms, transitions, timing, micro-interactions,
            and keyframes first — then you learned to accelerate that knowledge with AI."</p>
          <p class="mt-1">"Remember: animations should help users, not just look cool. Performance matters on every
            device. Accessibility is non-negotiable. And AI is a powerful assistant, but you're the one responsible for
            the code. Keep these principles close, and you'll build animations that delight users without harming them.
            Go build something wonderful! The web needs developers who understand both the craft and the
            responsibility." 🟠</p>
